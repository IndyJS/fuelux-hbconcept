# Fuel UX Handlebars Concept

Concept for using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates to streamline [Fuel UX](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux) development

Allows for one-step generation of markup and control instantiation using Handlebars helpers like `{{combobox mydata}}`

## TODO

* Enable RequireJS optimization
* Add datagrid and tree controls
* Support more parameters for customization
 * Similar to existing `{{radios mydata name="mygroup"}}`
* Internationalization support
* Consider databinding support, possibilities:

 * http://rivetsjs.com/
